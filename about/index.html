  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>I’m a seasoned backend developer specialized on Go and Node.js stacks. During the past three years I&rsquo;ve been mostly
working with Go, using it for different kinds of tasks ranging from simple CRUD APIs to image and audio processing
services. On top of that I have experience with MariaDB (MySQL), MongoDB, Redis and RabbitMQ.</p>
<p>I had experience working in a completely remote team for 3 years in the past. That was an interesting challenge, and it
really helped me to get better at managing my time and to learn to communicate efficiently.</p>
<p>I’m an avid learner and a very curious person who always tries to get to know how things work under the hood. Since I
believe, it’s the best way to truly understand something.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I really like sports: swimming, cycling, running.</p>
