  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>I’m an experienced backend developer mostly focused on Node.js stack, solving problems with TypeScript and sometimes with JavaScript. On top of that I have experience with MongoDB, MySQL (MariaDB) and Redis. Also I’m proficient with Docker and Kubernetes and I have good knowledge of Bash as an automation tool, since I’ve written many scripts for CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<p>I had experience working in a completely remote team for 3 years in the past. That was an interesting challenge, and it really helped me to get better at managing my time and to learn to communicate efficiently.</p>
<p>I’m an avid learner and a very curious person who always tries to get to know how things work under the hood. Since I believe, it’s the best way to truly understand something.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I really like sports: swimming, cycling, running. My goal for this year (2019) is to participate in a triathlon.</p>
